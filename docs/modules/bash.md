# HEE3-MOD-bash · bash

Thin shell/Just projection and verdict/argument preservation.

Primary path: `integrations/bash/README.stub.md`. Cluster: K6. This is the full planned responsibility; a reference exemplar exercises only its stated subset.

## Anchors and source ownership

[Source comment anchor](file:///var/home/herdr-engineering-engine-v3/integrations/bash/README.stub.md) · [Atlas module card](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Modules%2FMOD-bash) · [Scoped reference example](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Exemplars%2FEX-bash) · [Ultra map master](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Ultra%20Map%2FIndex) · [Codebase master](file:///var/home/herdr-engineering-engine-v3/README.md)

## Dependencies and integration

Declared build dependencies: actions. Declared consumers: none. Runtime request/return paths below do not imply cyclic build imports.

## Adopted readiness obligations

Own thin literal-value command wrappers and failure propagation. Preserve exit/signal, cancellation and readback; add recipes only for real supported entry points, with no shell interpolation of untrusted values.

Implementation groupings: [R90-03](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-03), [R90-07](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-07), [R90-09](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-09), [R90-10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-10). Original task prerequisites and all 13 completion gates remain controlling; package membership grants no action authority. Shared quality/security/interface rules apply to this module’s actual scope, without creating new runtime responsibilities.

**Resolved design contracts:** [RC02 · Pinned release profile and deployment custody](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC02), [RC03 · Versioned control and Rust–Julia contracts](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC03), [RC04 · Protected collection, receipts and independent oracles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC04), [RC05 · Trusted and adversarial execution profiles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC05). Apply the exact selected profile and pending-proof obligations.

Before a change, predict the affected owners and consumer contracts. Afterwards compare actual changes, rerun invalidated checks and retain counter-evidence. Minimum 50 distinct primary-owned cases, zero baseline diagnostics, trustworthy collection and independent parent/release acceptance remain mandatory.

## Public consumer interface contract

**HEE3-IF-bash** · proposed semantic contract; concrete callable signatures remain to be implemented and verified.

[Shared authority, visibility, compatibility and admission requirements](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FModule%20Public%20Contracts)

**Supported surface:** Documented thin Bash/Just command entry points with argv/JSON contracts over existing actions.

**Declared build consumers:** none; use the explicit integration surface.

| Operation obligation | Typed inputs to specify | Results to specify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invoke action safely | Literal positional/array arguments, bounded JSON and explicit task context | Structured result plus unambiguous producer exit verdict |
| Chain bounded commands | Declared input/output contracts, cancellation and timeout propagation | Ordered results and preserved failing producer status |
| Inspect usage and prerequisites | Wrapper/version and existing action metadata | Supported options and dependency/version diagnostics |

**Errors and bounds:** No eval or reparsing untrusted strings. Bound retries, output and environment inheritance; missing producer is failure.

**Effects, replay and concurrency:** No scheduler/policy duplication; wrappers do not grant actions. Pipe/tee/display success must not swallow producer failure.

**Required proof:** Whitespace/metacharacters; empty input; stderr/stdout separation; failing producer through pipeline; cancellation and dependency/version mismatch.

**Existing API references:** [API01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API01).

**Owned public actions:** none; mediated by declared consumers.

**Existing IPC associations:** [IPC01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC01). Association is not ownership or permission to open an endpoint.

Every operation inherits the catalogue requirements for caller capability, identity, schema/version, errors, bounds, cancellation/settlement, idempotency/readback, visibility, deprecation and exact evidence subject. Resolve concrete symbols, types and examples in the owning task before interface acceptance.

### Accepted current interface and implementation

Observed source kind: `comment_stub`. Accepted current interface: **unavailable**. No completion admission collector is implemented. A source body would be an implementation candidate, not automatically an accepted module. After verified admission exists, exact accepted source/schema and tests govern current interface facts; intended changes remain in the atlas.

Convention SHA-256: `aea027f65b69ed5d48e93d452294e9b87db9ffaca1d9566664ee710bfee98608`. This binding proves which documentation convention is projected, not runtime correctness.

Completion standard SHA-256: `0f5e3985b9598af8e836f09f91bbbb1d1831c9c886acbb851a1db0f1bb770a5a`. All 13 gates apply; only an inapplicable subcheck may be explicitly justified.

**Required finished behavior:** Thin Bash/Just entry points preserve literal arguments, bounded I/O, decisive producer exit and cancellation over existing action semantics.

**Integrated proof scenario:** Invoke a real admitted action with spaces/metacharacters and chain it through output capture while preserving structured result and failing producer status.

**Fault and benign controls:** Command-like input remains data, missing executable/failed pipeline/cancel returns failure, and a valid literal argument round-trips.

**Complexity boundary:** No eval, scheduler, policy fork or hand-edited generated wrapper; future dynamic arguments use qualified literal argv transport.

Engine coding is not authorized until human operator Luke types start coding as an actual instruction. Quoted text, a source note, a recipe or a handoff is not that instruction.

## Daybreak defensive security review

Requested model: `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`; select through the Codex `/model` picker and verify effective identity before the scoped review. Model selection and a reviewer message cannot accept this module.

**HEE3-SEC-bash:** Literal argv, shell metacharacters, pipeline producer status, environment and cancellation.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [LRN03 · Put the bound before allocation and the guard before effect](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN03) | Before parsing, allocation, fan-out, queue insertion, process launch or an irreversible effect. | Bound input acquisition and concurrency at the boundary; validate identities, capabilities and constraints before dispatch. |
| [LRN04 · One semantic owner across every consumer surface](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN04) | When adding a CLI, tool, Pi, Bash, workflow or cross-language entry point. | Use one typed owner and thin projections; pass source, environment, task and caller identities explicitly and preserve the return contract. |
| [LRN07 · Preserve producer verdict and process custody](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN07) | Before shell chaining, retrying a job, cancelling a process or presenting progress as success. | Capture the decisive producer status and raw output, keep explicit job/process/session identities and check existing obligations before retry or cleanup. |
| [LRN08 · Keep meaningful coverage and the zero-warning baseline](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN08) | When designing module tests, fixing lint diagnostics or reporting a hardening result. | Retain at least 50 distinct meaningful module-owned cases and zero baseline warnings/errors on every admitted profile; repair code and close material gaps. |

These are scoped design and review obligations. Their engine detectors remain unqualified; source reflections and navigation counts are not implementation evidence.

## Mandatory module testing standard

[Active testing standard and counting rules](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Standards%2FModule%20Testing): **minimum 50 distinct qualifying cases; zero baseline warnings and errors**, including pedantic Clippy for all admitted Rust targets/profiles.

Bind assimilation, mutation sensitivity, lint coverage and raw evidence to the exact candidate. Property iterations, assertions, retries, lint findings and mutant runs do not multiply case credits. The current observation schema does not establish this qualification.

Standard: `HEE3-TEST-STD-001`; SHA-256: `f21d963ad62ddf371cf2ec4c9c53b5012b4367d133ab1b0f1c729e5236eea4bb`. Full-standard qualification: **unassessed; collector/validator not implemented**.

Module priorities: literal argv and quoting; producer/pipeline exit status; cancellation and cleanup; schema/version/status preservation.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [F16 bash → actions](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Flows%2FFLOW-F16) | Typed argv/JSON and caller task context | Structured result, decisive exit status and evidence references | Paths/parameters remain literal and presentation cannot swallow a failing producer. |

## Delivery, verification and hardening contracts

### T14 · Add scoped lifecycle actions through systemd

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T14)

Dependencies: T07, T13. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Only explicitly managed units can change state; dependencies and result readback are checked; stalled service, restart loop and coordinator restart cases do not create competing process owners.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T14 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T17 · Exercise the critical failure matrix

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T17)

Dependencies: T07, T10, T14, T15, T16, T21, T22, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Lost completion, stalled runtime, stale lease, duplicate submission, exhausted budget, provider failure and disk error each hit the intended boundary. Record exact build/config and limitations; do not substitute test count for outcome. Fabricated done, wrong-subject evidence, mid-check artifact mutation, broken verifier, repeated non-progress, failed parent integration and lost final notification cannot produce false accepted completion. Exercise partial/coalesced frames, slow API readers, stale event cursors, wrong socket/session and lost response after effect. Inject failures between artifact write, durability publication and acceptance commit under the declared filesystem contract. Missing, expired or corrupt evidence at later readback must report current unavailability while preserving the historical event; no fresh verification may be inferred. Fault experiments distinguish invalid fixtures, excluded cells and unmeasured gates. A formatting rejection that prevents the intended behavioral fault does not prove that behavioral detector works.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T17 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T18 · Package and prove backup, upgrade and rollback

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T18)

Dependencies: T04, T14, T15, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Versioned artifact, dependencies and config are identifiable; login/reboot behaviour is observed; consistent backup restores tasks/artifacts; upgrade and schema-compatible rollback run on disposable state before installation. Before restoring a pre-upgrade database, preserve the failed/current ledger and reconcile post-backup operations, effects and usage. Use a disposable bounded qualification domain; a changed event epoch alone does not prevent replaying external effects erased by restore. Backup/restore and retention must preserve declared durability and unresolved evidence obligations. Retention policy states which accepted proof must remain retrievable; evidence loss is reported rather than silently rewriting acceptance or claiming current proof. Integration freshness reports include source additions/removals/changes; accepting an updated baseline is a separate versioned reconciliation, never an automatic consequence of discovery. Restore qualification compares the expected content/service inventory, includes an omitted-service control and independently reads back answering interfaces and residual processes in the disposable scope. File copying alone cannot prove restored operation; local recovery does not establish off-site disaster recovery.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T18 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T19 · Run the constrained real-work pilot

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T19)

Dependencies: T12, T16, T17, T18, T27. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Under the concrete commissioning choice D07, run the Phase-1 workload/window; measure accepted work, total cost, rework, idle calls and incidents. Meet declared release targets or fix the observed gap without widening scope. Audit sampled criterion-to-evidence records and real repair loops; report false acceptance, verification error and completion-delivery failures.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T19 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T20 · Release the scoped product and prune unnecessary machinery

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T20)

Dependencies: T19. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** A fresh operator can submit, inspect, cancel, recover and manage the declared services. Publish supported versions/limits and actual evidence. Remove duplicate status/procedure sources; advanced roadmap items remain optional. Pruning/update review keeps observed drift separate from the accepted baseline. Exact source anchors support presence/location claims only, not runtime behavior or compatibility.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T20 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T25 · Establish the Rust and Julia quality contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T25)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Pinned format/lint/test recipes include pedantic Clippy, supported feature profiles, Rust doctests, locked Julia tests with explicit bounds checks, and honest case/skip counts. A deliberately bad fixture fails for the intended reason. Checks grow with each vertical slice; no blanket lint suppression. The verifier recipe separates trusted launch/collection from candidate-controlled compiler/build/test processes. Captured process exit status is an observation; candidate structured reports remain claims requiring recipe checks and independent expectations. Early trusted-host fixture tests must disclose that stronger hostile-code containment is not yet qualified. Qualify consequential gate discrimination on a passing baseline and an independently justified fault with the intended failure reason; include benign near-neighbors where false positives matter. Non-blocking authoring hooks do not satisfy required release gates.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T25 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T26 · Define the threat model and security review contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T26)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Map task authority, context provenance, credentials, IPC, same-UID limits, isolation and trusted verifier ownership. Assign bounded negative cases and finding disposition. Confirm the selected security-model capability without granting extra execution authority. Include candidate-controlled build scripts, procedural macros, test binaries and Julia package hooks in the threat model; invoking them via a trusted verifier confers no collector authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T26 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T27 · Close security findings against the integrated release

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T27)

Dependencies: T15, T17, T18, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Reproduce material findings, verify fixes and residual dispositions on the actual packaged candidate. Prompt injection, credential exposure, socket/method misuse, stale writers, fabricated evidence, dependency drift and resource exhaustion cannot produce false acceptance. Model review alone is not closure. In disposable qualified fixtures, candidate build/test code attempts to alter protected fixture, evidence and control paths. The boundary must refuse the effect and the independent collector must expose the attempt; an exit-zero candidate report cannot certify its own integrity. Security fault cases require a valid unmutated baseline and the intended observable refusal. Preserve unmeasured/excluded scope; one corpus with no unique catch does not justify removing a gate.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T27 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T28 · Expose one authoritative action catalogue to CLI, API and LLM tools

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T28)

Dependencies: T03, T05, T06, T09, T25, T26. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** One action definition drives CLI/Unix schemas and one selected LLM-tool adapter. Bounded discovery/inspection/preview, scoped invocation, identity/idempotency and evidence readback work end to end. Denial remains denial across transports; untrusted workers receive no operator socket; generated projections cannot drift. task.get and analysis.get support their own principal-scoped admission-key readback; service.inspect can query the lifecycle operation key without confusing current health with historic effect. events.subscribe without a cursor provides a bounded coherent bootstrap snapshot plus high-water cursor. Distinguish request correlation from durable idempotency. Base Pi RPC does not supply the engine tool callback path; qualify the actual inherited channel or maintained bridge. Template-produced requests preserve literal typed values at the action boundary; model-emitted risk or approval fields never confer effect authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T28 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T29 · Qualify modular Bash, Pi, skill and workflow integration packages

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T29)

Dependencies: T21, T22, T25, T26, T28. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Thin updatable packages share action/procedure identity and preserve authority, arguments, producer exit status, cancellation and evidence. Pi errors/parallel calls/reload and effective tool-set readback are qualified; skills disclose bounded context. Two typed compositions close their real return paths. Version switching preserves active attempts and rollback; no separate scheduler or silent self-update. Keep the admitted package/protocol tuple pinned through every active attempt. Revoked/reloaded tool handlers cannot retain effect authority. No custom Pi-host glue is selected until its concrete packaging need is established. Each integration renders its owned template once, then passes literal typed data rather than copying/re-templating procedure bodies. Focused fixtures include braces, quotes, newlines, dollar signs and leading dashes, with exact final argv/JSON and producer-status checks. Preserve source and relationship coverage with whole-workflow context accounting. Source-change reports cannot advance accepted compatibility/source baselines.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T29 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

## Closure and rollout discipline

Apply the existing plan → execute → observe → verify → repair/escalate → verify → close loop. Before deployment, qualify the assembled candidate and relevant T25/T26 checks, T17 failures, T27 security finding closure and T18 backup/upgrade/rollback obligations in their declared scope. T19/T20 govern pilot and release; these links do not mark them complete. Package and configuration identity must match observed installation and useful readback. Preserve cancellation, uncertain effects, cleanup and rollback obligations separately.

A successful compile or lint of comment-only stubs is not module verification. The Rust pedantic-Clippy/test plan, Julia checks, transport/fault cases and security reviews remain governed by their actual task criteria. [The evidence and update protocol](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Ultra%20Map%2FUpdate%20Protocol) refreshes all corpus views after retained observations are admitted.

## Remaining reference-example limits

The disposable backend is a fixture. Actual future CLI grammar and packaged paths require qualification; the wrapper installs no runtime command.
