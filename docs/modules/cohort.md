# HEE3-MOD-cohort · cohort

Logical threads, assignments, resource claims and join obligations.

Primary path: `src/cohort.rs`. Cluster: K3. This is the full planned responsibility; a reference exemplar exercises only its stated subset.

## Dependencies and integration

Declared build dependencies: contracts. Declared consumers: app. Runtime request/return paths below do not imply cyclic build imports.

## Adopted readiness obligations

Own bounded specialist joins, resource allocations and parent cohesion. Waiting parents release child-needed resources; child success cannot substitute for integrated parent verification.

Implementation groupings: [R90-07](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-07), [R90-09](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-09), [R90-10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-10). Original task prerequisites and all 13 completion gates remain controlling; package membership grants no action authority. Shared quality/security/interface rules apply to this module’s actual scope, without creating new runtime responsibilities.

**Resolved design contracts:** [RC01 · First workload, numeric limits and evidence policy](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC01), [RC02 · Pinned release profile and deployment custody](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC02), [RC03 · Versioned control and Rust–Julia contracts](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC03), [RC04 · Protected collection, receipts and independent oracles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC04), [RC05 · Trusted and adversarial execution profiles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC05). Apply the exact selected profile and pending-proof obligations.

Before a change, predict the affected owners and consumer contracts. Afterwards compare actual changes, rerun invalidated checks and retain counter-evidence. Minimum 50 distinct primary-owned cases, zero baseline diagnostics, trustworthy collection and independent parent/release acceptance remain mandatory.

## Public consumer interface contract

**HEE3-IF-cohort** · proposed semantic contract; concrete callable signatures remain to be implemented and verified.

[Shared authority, visibility, compatibility and admission requirements](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FModule%20Public%20Contracts)

**Supported surface:** Rust orchestration facade for specialist threads, assignments, resource claims and parent joins; thread read actions project state.

**Declared build consumers:** app.

| Operation obligation | Typed inputs to specify | Results to specify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan and assign bounded work | Parent acceptance, finite child DAG, roles, revisions, budgets and resource claims | Thread/assignment identities and explicit dependencies |
| Read thread and collect candidates | Thread/cursor and child observations tied to current assignment | Bounded state, evidence, dissent and unresolved gaps |
| Join or revise work | Required child criteria, context revisions, conflict and final-verifier disposition | Parent integration candidate, repair plan or blocked join |

**Errors and bounds:** Bound concurrency, fan-out, token/time budgets and retries. Detect cycles, stale briefs, duplicate ownership and write conflicts.

**Effects, replay and concurrency:** One coordinator owns assignment/join; child success never accepts parent. Shared allocation is conserved and workspaces follow explicit custody.

**Required proof:** Disjoint work synergy; stale brief; overlapping writes; missing child; contradictory evidence; dissent preservation; failed join repair and final integrated verification.

**Existing API references:** [API01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API01), [API10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API10).

**Owned public actions:** [thread.get](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FActions%2FACT-thread.get), [thread.list](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FActions%2FACT-thread.list).

**Existing IPC associations:** [IPC01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC01), [IPC04](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC04). Association is not ownership or permission to open an endpoint.

Every operation inherits the catalogue requirements for caller capability, identity, schema/version, errors, bounds, cancellation/settlement, idempotency/readback, visibility, deprecation and exact evidence subject. Resolve concrete symbols, types and examples in the owning task before interface acceptance.

### Accepted current interface and implementation

Observed source kind: `engine_source`. Accepted current interface: **unavailable**. No completion admission collector is implemented. A source body would be an implementation candidate, not automatically an accepted module. After verified admission exists, exact accepted source/schema and tests govern current interface facts; intended changes remain in the atlas.

Convention SHA-256: `fe9171dc482e2121ffb85acc0fec7cc794ac64ed853a7f76cda794fead8124ec`. This binding proves which documentation convention is projected, not runtime correctness.

Completion standard SHA-256: `d593a1eef4c78de87afe0202ff1dcfbdd3c782692fae6480a425e40774b6a85b`. All 13 gates apply; only an inapplicable subcheck may be explicitly justified.

**Required finished behavior:** Bounded specialist threads maintain shared brief revisions, separate write/resource ownership, dissent and evidence-aware parent joins.

**Integrated proof scenario:** Split independent work, return compatible child results, detect an integration failure and repair/reverify the joined parent subject.

**Fault and benign controls:** Overlapping writes, stale brief, missing child or contradictory evidence prevents parent success; disjoint valid work can converge.

**Complexity boundary:** No second scheduler or majority vote replacing proof; synergy must show useful integration, not agent count.

Engine coding is not authorized until human operator Luke types start coding as an actual instruction. Quoted text, a source note, a recipe or a handoff is not that instruction.

## Daybreak defensive security review

Requested model: `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`; select through the Codex `/model` picker and verify effective identity before the scoped review. Model selection and a reviewer message cannot accept this module.

**HEE3-SEC-cohort:** Cross-thread write collisions, context/grant contamination, missing/contradictory child evidence and false parent joins.

These are scoped design and review obligations. Their engine detectors remain unqualified; source reflections and navigation counts are not implementation evidence.

## Mandatory module testing standard

[Active testing standard and counting rules](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Standards%2FModule%20Testing): **minimum 50 distinct qualifying cases; zero baseline warnings and errors**, including pedantic Clippy for all admitted Rust targets/profiles.

Bind assimilation, mutation sensitivity, lint coverage and raw evidence to the exact candidate. Property iterations, assertions, retries, lint findings and mutant runs do not multiply case credits. The current observation schema does not establish this qualification.

Standard: `HEE3-TEST-STD-001`; SHA-256: `f68d836a62a0522f46459f630f3beca159d1e87b6294a337101bd72392b5c578`. Full-standard qualification: **unassessed; collector/validator not implemented**.

Module priorities: thread/agent roster cohesion; ownership and claim transfer; join/fanout/cancellation; parent verification and stale messages.

## Delivery, verification and hardening contracts

### T05 · Build the model and agent roster

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T05)

Dependencies: T03, T04. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Profiles and instances are distinct; declared/effective capabilities and freshness are visible; disable prevents new work; importing a roster starts nothing; secrets remain references. SQLite owns admitted roster revisions. Reviewed TOML manifests are explicit bootstrap/import/export inputs through the same validated update authority: expected-absent creates, expected-revision updates. Invalid or stale import changes nothing. Test update/disable, restart and stale re-import; no admitted mutation is lost and disabled records remain disabled. Active attempts retain their pinned record snapshots.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T05 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T10 · Account for whole-task cost and bounded fallback

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T10)

Dependencies: T04, T08, T09. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Concurrent reservations cannot exceed configured bounds; retries/checking/compaction are included; unknown usage is visible; hard-ceiling tasks reject incompatible accounting; fallback cannot cross privacy or tool constraints.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T10 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T11 · Minimise repeated context and noisy supervision

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T11)

Dependencies: T06, T10. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Context is bounded to task needs; actionable wakes are deduplicated/batched; controlled idle and repeated unchanged events cause zero model requests; summaries and compaction usage are accounted for. Context records distinguish required source-file coverage from task-critical call/dependency/ownership relationship coverage. Expose each gap and account for discovery, supplemental reads and repeated context as well as final packet size.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T11 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T12 · Compare routing against a fixed-model baseline

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T12)

Dependencies: T09, T10, T11, T21, T22. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Held-out representative tasks use the same acceptance method; failed/abandoned attempts enter cost totals; report uncertainty by class and review work. Retain a simple policy unless a challenger improves the declared tradeoff. Julia reports routing and cohort comparisons from the same immutable outcomes, with uncertainty and missingness. Include failed, cancelled and abandoned attempts and unknown usage at an explicit dataset cutoff; disclose exclusion and censoring policy.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T12 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T14 · Add scoped lifecycle actions through systemd

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T14)

Dependencies: T07, T13. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Only explicitly managed units can change state; dependencies and result readback are checked; stalled service, restart loop and coordinator restart cases do not create competing process owners.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T14 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T17 · Exercise the critical failure matrix

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T17)

Dependencies: T07, T10, T14, T15, T16, T21, T22, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Lost completion, stalled runtime, stale lease, duplicate submission, exhausted budget, provider failure and disk error each hit the intended boundary. Record exact build/config and limitations; do not substitute test count for outcome. Fabricated done, wrong-subject evidence, mid-check artifact mutation, broken verifier, repeated non-progress, failed parent integration and lost final notification cannot produce false accepted completion. Exercise partial/coalesced frames, slow API readers, stale event cursors, wrong socket/session and lost response after effect. Inject failures between artifact write, durability publication and acceptance commit under the declared filesystem contract. Missing, expired or corrupt evidence at later readback must report current unavailability while preserving the historical event; no fresh verification may be inferred. Fault experiments distinguish invalid fixtures, excluded cells and unmeasured gates. A formatting rejection that prevents the intended behavioral fault does not prove that behavioral detector works.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T17 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T18 · Package and prove backup, upgrade and rollback

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T18)

Dependencies: T04, T14, T15, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Versioned artifact, dependencies and config are identifiable; login/reboot behaviour is observed; consistent backup restores tasks/artifacts; upgrade and schema-compatible rollback run on disposable state before installation. Before restoring a pre-upgrade database, preserve the failed/current ledger and reconcile post-backup operations, effects and usage. Use a disposable bounded qualification domain; a changed event epoch alone does not prevent replaying external effects erased by restore. Backup/restore and retention must preserve declared durability and unresolved evidence obligations. Retention policy states which accepted proof must remain retrievable; evidence loss is reported rather than silently rewriting acceptance or claiming current proof. Integration freshness reports include source additions/removals/changes; accepting an updated baseline is a separate versioned reconciliation, never an automatic consequence of discovery. Restore qualification compares the expected content/service inventory, includes an omitted-service control and independently reads back answering interfaces and residual processes in the disposable scope. File copying alone cannot prove restored operation; local recovery does not establish off-site disaster recovery.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T18 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T19 · Run the constrained real-work pilot

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T19)

Dependencies: T12, T16, T17, T18, T27. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Under the concrete commissioning choice D07, run the Phase-1 workload/window; measure accepted work, total cost, rework, idle calls and incidents. Meet declared release targets or fix the observed gap without widening scope. Audit sampled criterion-to-evidence records and real repair loops; report false acceptance, verification error and completion-delivery failures.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T19 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T20 · Release the scoped product and prune unnecessary machinery

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T20)

Dependencies: T19. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** A fresh operator can submit, inspect, cancel, recover and manage the declared services. Publish supported versions/limits and actual evidence. Remove duplicate status/procedure sources; advanced roadmap items remain optional. Pruning/update review keeps observed drift separate from the accepted baseline. Exact source anchors support presence/location claims only, not runtime behavior or compatibility.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T20 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T22 · Add bounded cohorts and measurable cohesion

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T22)

Dependencies: T07, T10, T11, T21. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Roles share a versioned objective, distinct artifact ownership and bounded messages. Cross-agent resource conflicts and stale-generation callbacks are rejected. Compare one-worker and specialist-cohort outcomes including cost, errors, disagreement and rework; idle cohorts stop. Persist logical thread identity, versioned mailbox obligations and parent join requirements; protect shared interface/lockfile ownership and recover orchestrator loss without duplicate dispatch. Enforce one conserved parent/child allocation tree. Waiting parents release resources children require. Semantic cross-module calls remain mediated by the composition root and current action authority. Thread briefs preserve the task-critical relationships needed by the receiving specialist; a list of included files alone cannot prove adequate context. Narrow the question explicitly when required coverage exceeds its bound.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T22 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T25 · Establish the Rust and Julia quality contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T25)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Pinned format/lint/test recipes include pedantic Clippy, supported feature profiles, Rust doctests, locked Julia tests with explicit bounds checks, and honest case/skip counts. A deliberately bad fixture fails for the intended reason. Checks grow with each vertical slice; no blanket lint suppression. The verifier recipe separates trusted launch/collection from candidate-controlled compiler/build/test processes. Captured process exit status is an observation; candidate structured reports remain claims requiring recipe checks and independent expectations. Early trusted-host fixture tests must disclose that stronger hostile-code containment is not yet qualified. Qualify consequential gate discrimination on a passing baseline and an independently justified fault with the intended failure reason; include benign near-neighbors where false positives matter. Non-blocking authoring hooks do not satisfy required release gates.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T25 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T26 · Define the threat model and security review contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T26)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Map task authority, context provenance, credentials, IPC, same-UID limits, isolation and trusted verifier ownership. Assign bounded negative cases and finding disposition. Confirm the selected security-model capability without granting extra execution authority. Include candidate-controlled build scripts, procedural macros, test binaries and Julia package hooks in the threat model; invoking them via a trusted verifier confers no collector authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T26 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T27 · Close security findings against the integrated release

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T27)

Dependencies: T15, T17, T18, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Reproduce material findings, verify fixes and residual dispositions on the actual packaged candidate. Prompt injection, credential exposure, socket/method misuse, stale writers, fabricated evidence, dependency drift and resource exhaustion cannot produce false acceptance. Model review alone is not closure. In disposable qualified fixtures, candidate build/test code attempts to alter protected fixture, evidence and control paths. The boundary must refuse the effect and the independent collector must expose the attempt; an exit-zero candidate report cannot certify its own integrity. Security fault cases require a valid unmutated baseline and the intended observable refusal. Preserve unmeasured/excluded scope; one corpus with no unique catch does not justify removing a gate.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T27 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T29 · Qualify modular Bash, Pi, skill and workflow integration packages

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T29)

Dependencies: T21, T22, T25, T26, T28. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Thin updatable packages share action/procedure identity and preserve authority, arguments, producer exit status, cancellation and evidence. Pi errors/parallel calls/reload and effective tool-set readback are qualified; skills disclose bounded context. Two typed compositions close their real return paths. Version switching preserves active attempts and rollback; no separate scheduler or silent self-update. Keep the admitted package/protocol tuple pinned through every active attempt. Revoked/reloaded tool handlers cannot retain effect authority. No custom Pi-host glue is selected until its concrete packaging need is established. Each integration renders its owned template once, then passes literal typed data rather than copying/re-templating procedure bodies. Focused fixtures include braces, quotes, newlines, dollar signs and leading dashes, with exact final argv/JSON and producer-status checks. Preserve source and relationship coverage with whole-workflow context accounting. Source-change reports cannot advance accepted compatibility/source baselines.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T29 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

## Closure and rollout discipline

Apply the existing plan → execute → observe → verify → repair/escalate → verify → close loop. Before deployment, qualify the assembled candidate and relevant T25/T26 checks, T17 failures, T27 security finding closure and T18 backup/upgrade/rollback obligations in their declared scope. T19/T20 govern pilot and release; these links do not mark them complete. Package and configuration identity must match observed installation and useful readback. Preserve cancellation, uncertain effects, cleanup and rollback obligations separately.

A successful compile or lint of comment-only stubs is not module verification. The Rust pedantic-Clippy/test plan, Julia checks, transport/fault cases and security reviews remain governed by their actual task criteria. [The evidence and update protocol](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Ultra%20Map%2FUpdate%20Protocol) refreshes all corpus views after retained observations are admitted.

## Remaining reference-example limits

Resource IDs are canonical fixture identities. Worktree/path conflict detection, durable leases, scheduler fairness and semantic integration remain future work.
