# HEE3-MOD-herdr · herdr

Herdr client adaptation and task/pane presentation links.

Primary path: `src/herdr.rs`. Cluster: K5. This is the full planned responsibility; a reference exemplar exercises only its stated subset.

## Anchors and source ownership

## Dependencies and integration

Declared build dependencies: contracts. Declared consumers: app. Runtime request/return paths below do not imply cyclic build imports.

## Adopted readiness obligations

Own presentation of the actual task/evidence/service state. Distinguish desired, observed, stale and accepted states; UI controls use the same action authority and readback contract.

Implementation groupings: [R90-03](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-03), [R90-07](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-07), [R90-09](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-09), [R90-10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-10). Original task prerequisites and all 13 completion gates remain controlling; package membership grants no action authority. Shared quality/security/interface rules apply to this module’s actual scope, without creating new runtime responsibilities.

**Resolved design contracts:** [RC02 · Pinned release profile and deployment custody](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC02), [RC03 · Versioned control and Rust–Julia contracts](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC03), [RC04 · Protected collection, receipts and independent oracles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC04), [RC05 · Trusted and adversarial execution profiles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC05). Apply the exact selected profile and pending-proof obligations.

Before a change, predict the affected owners and consumer contracts. Afterwards compare actual changes, rerun invalidated checks and retain counter-evidence. Minimum 50 distinct primary-owned cases, zero baseline diagnostics, trustworthy collection and independent parent/release acceptance remain mandatory.

## Public consumer interface contract

**HEE3-IF-herdr** · proposed semantic contract; concrete callable signatures remain to be implemented and verified.

[Shared authority, visibility, compatibility and admission requirements](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FModule%20Public%20Contracts)

**Supported surface:** Supported multiplexer/client integration surface calling existing actions/app interfaces; presentation remains a client.

**Declared build consumers:** app.

| Operation obligation | Typed inputs to specify | Results to specify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Submit operator intent | Typed task context, explicit user constraints and caller authority | Admission/denial and durable task identity |
| Present task/thread state | Versioned snapshots, events and evidence references | Status, route explanation, gaps and navigable proof |
| Reconnect or request cancellation | Last cursor/epoch and task identity | Rebuilt view or acknowledged cancellation obligation |

**Errors and bounds:** Bound UI event buffers and reconnects. Pane title, process exit or rendered done text cannot establish task acceptance.

**Effects, replay and concurrency:** No second scheduler or authoritative task state in panes. Client loss leaves engine obligations durable.

**Required proof:** Pane loss and reconnect; duplicate UI submission; stale event; explicit cancellation; truthful failure/unknown presentation and proof navigation.

**Existing API references:** [API06](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API06).

**Owned public actions:** none; mediated by declared consumers.

**Existing IPC associations:** [IPC02](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC02). Association is not ownership or permission to open an endpoint.

Every operation inherits the catalogue requirements for caller capability, identity, schema/version, errors, bounds, cancellation/settlement, idempotency/readback, visibility, deprecation and exact evidence subject. Resolve concrete symbols, types and examples in the owning task before interface acceptance.

### Accepted current interface and implementation

Observed source kind: `engine_source`. Accepted current interface: **unavailable**. No completion admission collector is implemented. A source body would be an implementation candidate, not automatically an accepted module. After verified admission exists, exact accepted source/schema and tests govern current interface facts; intended changes remain in the atlas.

Convention SHA-256: `ddd56488c228140c6b1e239691d4b9a6c34fcd8edb3770a2ad9206354b42aabd`. This binding proves which documentation convention is projected, not runtime correctness.

Completion standard SHA-256: `b0f0ee8c52c2b93249f49e5048d274a18beb0ffdbd294b0731d486a09dbf31be`. All 13 gates apply; only an inapplicable subcheck may be explicitly justified.

**Required finished behavior:** The multiplexer/client presents truthful task, thread, route and proof state and reconnects through the same versioned action semantics.

**Integrated proof scenario:** Submit operator intent, lose the pane/client, reconnect by epoch/cursor and navigate the retained task evidence.

**Fault and benign controls:** Duplicate submission, stale event, display failure and cancellation do not invent acceptance; valid current state remains visible.

**Complexity boundary:** Panes are clients, not authoritative rosters, schedulers or completion databases.

Engine coding is not authorized until human operator Luke types start coding as an actual instruction. Quoted text, a source note, a recipe or a handoff is not that instruction.

## Daybreak defensive security review

Requested model: `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`; select through the Codex `/model` picker and verify effective identity before the scoped review. Model selection and a reviewer message cannot accept this module.

**HEE3-SEC-herdr:** Client/pane authority confusion, stale UI truth, reconnect/cancel and duplicate submission.

| [LRN01 · Earn the verdict from the complete subject](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN01) | Before quoting a result, admitting a module, closing a parent or presenting done in a client. | Report a typed scoped verdict with exact candidate, admitted criteria, required checks, raw evidence, gaps and a counter-evidence pointer. |
| [LRN08 · Keep meaningful coverage and the zero-warning baseline](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN08) | When designing module tests, fixing lint diagnostics or reporting a hardening result. | Retain at least 50 distinct meaningful module-owned cases and zero baseline warnings/errors on every admitted profile; repair code and close material gaps. |

These are scoped design and review obligations. Their engine detectors remain unqualified; source reflections and navigation counts are not implementation evidence.

## Mandatory module testing standard

[Active testing standard and counting rules](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Standards%2FModule%20Testing): **minimum 50 distinct qualifying cases; zero baseline warnings and errors**, including pedantic Clippy for all admitted Rust targets/profiles.

Bind assimilation, mutation sensitivity, lint coverage and raw evidence to the exact candidate. Property iterations, assertions, retries, lint findings and mutant runs do not multiply case credits. The current observation schema does not establish this qualification.

Standard: `HEE3-TEST-STD-001`; SHA-256: `d643fb699b502af05898a718aec4eb9f9461b882cfbb94a89850358166e69336`. Full-standard qualification: **unassessed; collector/validator not implemented**.

Module priorities: session/socket/generation binding; pane/agent identity drift; presentation versus engine authority; disconnect/reconnect and roundtrip contracts.

## Bidirectional contracts

| Flow | Request | Return | Closure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [F01 herdr → task](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Flows%2FFLOW-F01) | Versioned intent and operator constraints enter actions/app; authenticated task-scoped request reaches task | Status, route reason, blocking criterion and completion references | Pane loss does not lose the task; a displayed done message cannot accept it. |

## APIs, sockets and commands

[API06](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API06)

| IPC | Endpoint | Custody and recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |

Retain session/socket/pane identity; never clean up another service endpoint. Resubscribe and snapshot reconcile; captured schema has no durable cursor. Gap-free history not promised. |

## Delivery, verification and hardening contracts

### T14 · Add scoped lifecycle actions through systemd

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T14)

Dependencies: T07, T13. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Only explicitly managed units can change state; dependencies and result readback are checked; stalled service, restart loop and coordinator restart cases do not create competing process owners.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T14 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T16 · Expose the task and roster views in Herdr

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T16)

Dependencies: T07, T11, T13. Atlas task state: `wip`.

**Acceptance:** Task cards show owner, model, state, spend and outcome; pane closure does not erase task state; reconnect resynchronises; event gap/poll fallback and user cancel are exercised on the actual public Herdr API. Display the current loop iteration, failing criterion, remaining budget, completion evidence and notification state. The captured Herdr protocol has live events without durable replay cursors. Qualify resubscription and coherent snapshot reconciliation; do not claim gap-free Herdr history.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T16 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T17 · Exercise the critical failure matrix

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T17)

Dependencies: T07, T10, T14, T15, T16, T21, T22, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Lost completion, stalled runtime, stale lease, duplicate submission, exhausted budget, provider failure and disk error each hit the intended boundary. Record exact build/config and limitations; do not substitute test count for outcome. Fabricated done, wrong-subject evidence, mid-check artifact mutation, broken verifier, repeated non-progress, failed parent integration and lost final notification cannot produce false accepted completion. Exercise partial/coalesced frames, slow API readers, stale event cursors, wrong socket/session and lost response after effect. Inject failures between artifact write, durability publication and acceptance commit under the declared filesystem contract. Missing, expired or corrupt evidence at later readback must report current unavailability while preserving the historical event; no fresh verification may be inferred. Fault experiments distinguish invalid fixtures, excluded cells and unmeasured gates. A formatting rejection that prevents the intended behavioral fault does not prove that behavioral detector works.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T17 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T18 · Package and prove backup, upgrade and rollback

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T18)

Dependencies: T04, T14, T15, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Versioned artifact, dependencies and config are identifiable; login/reboot behaviour is observed; consistent backup restores tasks/artifacts; upgrade and schema-compatible rollback run on disposable state before installation. Before restoring a pre-upgrade database, preserve the failed/current ledger and reconcile post-backup operations, effects and usage. Use a disposable bounded qualification domain; a changed event epoch alone does not prevent replaying external effects erased by restore. Backup/restore and retention must preserve declared durability and unresolved evidence obligations. Retention policy states which accepted proof must remain retrievable; evidence loss is reported rather than silently rewriting acceptance or claiming current proof. Integration freshness reports include source additions/removals/changes; accepting an updated baseline is a separate versioned reconciliation, never an automatic consequence of discovery. Restore qualification compares the expected content/service inventory, includes an omitted-service control and independently reads back answering interfaces and residual processes in the disposable scope. File copying alone cannot prove restored operation; local recovery does not establish off-site disaster recovery.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T18 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T19 · Run the constrained real-work pilot

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T19)

Dependencies: T12, T16, T17, T18, T27. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Under the concrete commissioning choice D07, run the Phase-1 workload/window; measure accepted work, total cost, rework, idle calls and incidents. Meet declared release targets or fix the observed gap without widening scope. Audit sampled criterion-to-evidence records and real repair loops; report false acceptance, verification error and completion-delivery failures.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T19 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T20 · Release the scoped product and prune unnecessary machinery

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T20)

Dependencies: T19. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** A fresh operator can submit, inspect, cancel, recover and manage the declared services. Publish supported versions/limits and actual evidence. Remove duplicate status/procedure sources; advanced roadmap items remain optional. Pruning/update review keeps observed drift separate from the accepted baseline. Exact source anchors support presence/location claims only, not runtime behavior or compatibility.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T20 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T25 · Establish the Rust and Julia quality contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T25)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Pinned format/lint/test recipes include pedantic Clippy, supported feature profiles, Rust doctests, locked Julia tests with explicit bounds checks, and honest case/skip counts. A deliberately bad fixture fails for the intended reason. Checks grow with each vertical slice; no blanket lint suppression. The verifier recipe separates trusted launch/collection from candidate-controlled compiler/build/test processes. Captured process exit status is an observation; candidate structured reports remain claims requiring recipe checks and independent expectations. Early trusted-host fixture tests must disclose that stronger hostile-code containment is not yet qualified. Qualify consequential gate discrimination on a passing baseline and an independently justified fault with the intended failure reason; include benign near-neighbors where false positives matter. Non-blocking authoring hooks do not satisfy required release gates.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T25 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T26 · Define the threat model and security review contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T26)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Map task authority, context provenance, credentials, IPC, same-UID limits, isolation and trusted verifier ownership. Assign bounded negative cases and finding disposition. Confirm the selected security-model capability without granting extra execution authority. Include candidate-controlled build scripts, procedural macros, test binaries and Julia package hooks in the threat model; invoking them via a trusted verifier confers no collector authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T26 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T27 · Close security findings against the integrated release

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T27)

Dependencies: T15, T17, T18, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Reproduce material findings, verify fixes and residual dispositions on the actual packaged candidate. Prompt injection, credential exposure, socket/method misuse, stale writers, fabricated evidence, dependency drift and resource exhaustion cannot produce false acceptance. Model review alone is not closure. In disposable qualified fixtures, candidate build/test code attempts to alter protected fixture, evidence and control paths. The boundary must refuse the effect and the independent collector must expose the attempt; an exit-zero candidate report cannot certify its own integrity. Security fault cases require a valid unmutated baseline and the intended observable refusal. Preserve unmeasured/excluded scope; one corpus with no unique catch does not justify removing a gate.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T27 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

## Closure and rollout discipline

Apply the existing plan → execute → observe → verify → repair/escalate → verify → close loop. Before deployment, qualify the assembled candidate and relevant T25/T26 checks, T17 failures, T27 security finding closure and T18 backup/upgrade/rollback obligations in their declared scope. T19/T20 govern pilot and release; these links do not mark them complete. Package and configuration identity must match observed installation and useful readback. Preserve cancellation, uncertain effects, cleanup and rollback obligations separately.

A successful compile or lint of comment-only stubs is not module verification. The Rust pedantic-Clippy/test plan, Julia checks, transport/fault cases and security reviews remain governed by their actual task criteria. [The evidence and update protocol](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Ultra%20Map%2FUpdate%20Protocol) refreshes all corpus views after retained observations are admitted.

## Remaining reference-example limits

Session/socket identity binding and discovery, installed-pair protocol qualification, socket credentials and reconnect behavior remain production work requiring live adapter testing.
