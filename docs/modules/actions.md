# HEE3-MOD-actions · actions

Authoritative typed action catalogue, capability projection and transport dispatch metadata.

Primary path: `src/actions.rs`. Cluster: K6. This is the full planned responsibility; a reference exemplar exercises only its stated subset.

## Anchors and source ownership

## Dependencies and integration

Declared build dependencies: contracts. Declared consumers: app, bash, pi_extension, skills, workflows. Runtime request/return paths below do not imply cyclic build imports.

## Adopted readiness obligations

Own one semantic action catalogue projected to CLI, Unix API and LLM tools. Model-provided risk/approval fields cannot grant authority; same fixtures must produce equivalent decisions across surfaces.

Implementation groupings: [R90-03](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-03), [R90-06](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-06), [R90-07](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-07), [R90-09](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-09), [R90-10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FReadiness%2FR90-10). Original task prerequisites and all 13 completion gates remain controlling; package membership grants no action authority. Shared quality/security/interface rules apply to this module’s actual scope, without creating new runtime responsibilities.

**Resolved design contracts:** [RC02 · Pinned release profile and deployment custody](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC02), [RC03 · Versioned control and Rust–Julia contracts](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC03), [RC04 · Protected collection, receipts and independent oracles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC04), [RC05 · Trusted and adversarial execution profiles](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC05), [RC06 · SQLite, migration freeze and recovery](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FContracts%2FRC06). Apply the exact selected profile and pending-proof obligations.

Before a change, predict the affected owners and consumer contracts. Afterwards compare actual changes, rerun invalidated checks and retain counter-evidence. Minimum 50 distinct primary-owned cases, zero baseline diagnostics, trustworthy collection and independent parent/release acceptance remain mandatory.

## Public consumer interface contract

**HEE3-IF-actions** · proposed semantic contract; concrete callable signatures remain to be implemented and verified.

[Shared authority, visibility, compatibility and admission requirements](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FModule%20Public%20Contracts)

**Supported surface:** Versioned authoritative action catalogue, inspectable schemas and typed dispatch metadata for CLI/Unix/tool projections.

**Declared build consumers:** app, bash, pi_extension, skills, workflows.

| Operation obligation | Typed inputs to specify | Results to specify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List visible capabilities | Caller identity, optional bounded filter/page and catalogue revision | Visible action IDs/versions/purpose and pagination |
| Inspect a supported action | Visible stable action ID and requested version | Input/result/error schema, authority, effect, bounds and retry/readback contract |
| Validate dispatch metadata | Caller-bound action request and transport context | Typed dispatch to the existing owner or explicit denial/incompatibility |

**Errors and bounds:** Reject unknown versions, ambiguous fields and ungranted effects before dispatch. Catalogue visibility is recalculated for caller.

**Effects, replay and concurrency:** One action definition projects to all transports; wrapper/tool names cannot elevate authority. Does not create another task engine.

**Required proof:** Complete 21-action owner projection; schema drift; unknown/hidden action; denied effect; CLI/tool/UDS parity and literal input preservation.

**Existing API references:** [API01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API01), [API10](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FAPI%2FAPI-API10).

**Owned public actions:** [tools.list](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FActions%2FACT-tools.list), [tools.inspect](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FActions%2FACT-tools.inspect).

**Existing IPC associations:** [IPC01](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC01), [IPC04](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Interfaces%2FIPC%2FIPC-IPC04). Association is not ownership or permission to open an endpoint.

Every operation inherits the catalogue requirements for caller capability, identity, schema/version, errors, bounds, cancellation/settlement, idempotency/readback, visibility, deprecation and exact evidence subject. Resolve concrete symbols, types and examples in the owning task before interface acceptance.

### Accepted current interface and implementation

Observed source kind: `comment_stub`. Accepted current interface: **unavailable**. No completion admission collector is implemented. A source body would be an implementation candidate, not automatically an accepted module. After verified admission exists, exact accepted source/schema and tests govern current interface facts; intended changes remain in the atlas.

Convention SHA-256: `089e6c05bbe6f53db1c473153d26638028b2e3c8f99d99967d8f0e7baa97bb8d`. This binding proves which documentation convention is projected, not runtime correctness.

Completion standard SHA-256: `860dc3c4021b780b94ddcb8b9af22c4fd09fe3590e7785de0bcf5a3b5025c3ea`. All 13 gates apply; only an inapplicable subcheck may be explicitly justified.

**Required finished behavior:** One versioned catalogue gives caller-visible discovery, typed inspection and dispatch contracts for all 21 declared actions.

**Integrated proof scenario:** List and inspect permitted actions, invoke one through CLI/tool/UDS and compare semantic result/error/effect identities.

**Fault and benign controls:** Hidden action, unknown version, malformed argument and ungranted effect refuse before dispatch; visible compatible action retains identical semantics.

**Complexity boundary:** An advertised action is not an authority grant; wrappers must derive from the same owner.

Engine coding is not authorized until human operator Luke types start coding as an actual instruction. Quoted text, a source note, a recipe or a handoff is not that instruction.

## Daybreak defensive security review

Requested model: `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`; select through the Codex `/model` picker and verify effective identity before the scoped review. Model selection and a reviewer message cannot accept this module.

**HEE3-SEC-actions:** Hidden capability leakage, schema/version drift, ungranted effect and CLI/tool/UDS parity.

| [LRN02 · Qualify the detector before trusting its scan](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN02) | Before a new or changed detector is allowed to establish a clean result. | Bind an intended-fault fixture and a benign mirror to the exact production check path, with a stable fault definition and expected diagnostic. |
| [LRN03 · Put the bound before allocation and the guard before effect](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN03) | Before parsing, allocation, fan-out, queue insertion, process launch or an irreversible effect. | Bound input acquisition and concurrency at the boundary; validate identities, capabilities and constraints before dispatch. |
| [LRN04 · One semantic owner across every consumer surface](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Learnings%2FLRN04) | When adding a CLI, tool, Pi, Bash, workflow or cross-language entry point. | Use one typed owner and thin projections; pass source, environment, task and caller identities explicitly and preserve the return contract. |

Record the problem, placement, footprint, verification cost, prevented failure, false-positive/rework cost and retirement condition. |

These are scoped design and review obligations. Their engine detectors remain unqualified; source reflections and navigation counts are not implementation evidence.

## Mandatory module testing standard

[Active testing standard and counting rules](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Standards%2FModule%20Testing): **minimum 50 distinct qualifying cases; zero baseline warnings and errors**, including pedantic Clippy for all admitted Rust targets/profiles.

Bind assimilation, mutation sensitivity, lint coverage and raw evidence to the exact candidate. Property iterations, assertions, retries, lint findings and mutant runs do not multiply case credits. The current observation schema does not establish this qualification.

Standard: `HEE3-TEST-STD-001`; SHA-256: `1004749abf352815dc13b8317c4277ea124d06612137e9010666977bfd059986`. Full-standard qualification: **unassessed; collector/validator not implemented**.

Module priorities: command/tool schema equivalence; method authority and effect classification; idempotency/readback/correlation; hostile arguments and consistent errors.

## Delivery, verification and hardening contracts

### T01 · Define the first task and release contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T01)

Dependencies: none. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** A real contained development task names inputs, acceptance, privacy, budget mode, pilot workload/window and measurable release targets. It can be expressed without an LLM or an inherited HEE packet set. Define loop limits, no-progress policy, criterion-to-verifier mapping and the minimal completion predicate before dispatch. Fix the initial module responsibilities, bidirectional boundary contracts and API/Unix-socket schema, with one state owner and no circular build dependencies. Freeze the minimal action IDs/envelope, error taxonomy, idempotency selector and state dimensions before the early CLI/UDS slice. Declare actual numeric resource/transport bounds during contract implementation.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T01 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T14 · Add scoped lifecycle actions through systemd

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T14)

Dependencies: T07, T13. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Only explicitly managed units can change state; dependencies and result readback are checked; stalled service, restart loop and coordinator restart cases do not create competing process owners.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T14 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T15 · Qualify worker isolation and secret delivery

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T15)

Dependencies: T08, T10, T14. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Untrusted worker cannot read coordinator state/socket or unintended credentials; argv/env/cwd are explicit; resource and process-group cleanup are tested; trusted-host mode has an honest separate claim. Qualify isolation for candidate-controlled verification subprocesses, including build.rs, procedural macros, tests and Julia hooks. The trusted launcher/collector remains outside that execution domain; candidate code cannot modify protected fixtures, authoritative evidence, ledger/socket or unrelated secrets.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T15 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T16 · Expose the task and roster views in Herdr

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T16)

Dependencies: T07, T11, T13. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Task cards show owner, model, state, spend and outcome; pane closure does not erase task state; reconnect resynchronises; event gap/poll fallback and user cancel are exercised on the actual public Herdr API. Display the current loop iteration, failing criterion, remaining budget, completion evidence and notification state. The captured Herdr protocol has live events without durable replay cursors. Qualify resubscription and coherent snapshot reconciliation; do not claim gap-free Herdr history.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T16 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T17 · Exercise the critical failure matrix

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T17)

Dependencies: T07, T10, T14, T15, T16, T21, T22, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Lost completion, stalled runtime, stale lease, duplicate submission, exhausted budget, provider failure and disk error each hit the intended boundary. Record exact build/config and limitations; do not substitute test count for outcome. Fabricated done, wrong-subject evidence, mid-check artifact mutation, broken verifier, repeated non-progress, failed parent integration and lost final notification cannot produce false accepted completion. Exercise partial/coalesced frames, slow API readers, stale event cursors, wrong socket/session and lost response after effect. Inject failures between artifact write, durability publication and acceptance commit under the declared filesystem contract. Missing, expired or corrupt evidence at later readback must report current unavailability while preserving the historical event; no fresh verification may be inferred. Fault experiments distinguish invalid fixtures, excluded cells and unmeasured gates. A formatting rejection that prevents the intended behavioral fault does not prove that behavioral detector works.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T17 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T18 · Package and prove backup, upgrade and rollback

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T18)

Dependencies: T04, T14, T15, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Versioned artifact, dependencies and config are identifiable; login/reboot behaviour is observed; consistent backup restores tasks/artifacts; upgrade and schema-compatible rollback run on disposable state before installation. Before restoring a pre-upgrade database, preserve the failed/current ledger and reconcile post-backup operations, effects and usage. Use a disposable bounded qualification domain; a changed event epoch alone does not prevent replaying external effects erased by restore. Backup/restore and retention must preserve declared durability and unresolved evidence obligations. Retention policy states which accepted proof must remain retrievable; evidence loss is reported rather than silently rewriting acceptance or claiming current proof. Integration freshness reports include source additions/removals/changes; accepting an updated baseline is a separate versioned reconciliation, never an automatic consequence of discovery. Restore qualification compares the expected content/service inventory, includes an omitted-service control and independently reads back answering interfaces and residual processes in the disposable scope. File copying alone cannot prove restored operation; local recovery does not establish off-site disaster recovery.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T18 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T19 · Run the constrained real-work pilot

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T19)

Dependencies: T12, T16, T17, T18, T27. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Under the concrete commissioning choice D07, run the Phase-1 workload/window; measure accepted work, total cost, rework, idle calls and incidents. Meet declared release targets or fix the observed gap without widening scope. Audit sampled criterion-to-evidence records and real repair loops; report false acceptance, verification error and completion-delivery failures.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T19 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T20 · Release the scoped product and prune unnecessary machinery

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T20)

Dependencies: T19. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** A fresh operator can submit, inspect, cancel, recover and manage the declared services. Publish supported versions/limits and actual evidence. Remove duplicate status/procedure sources; advanced roadmap items remain optional. Pruning/update review keeps observed drift separate from the accepted baseline. Exact source anchors support presence/location claims only, not runtime behavior or compatibility.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T20 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T25 · Establish the Rust and Julia quality contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T25)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Pinned format/lint/test recipes include pedantic Clippy, supported feature profiles, Rust doctests, locked Julia tests with explicit bounds checks, and honest case/skip counts. A deliberately bad fixture fails for the intended reason. Checks grow with each vertical slice; no blanket lint suppression. The verifier recipe separates trusted launch/collection from candidate-controlled compiler/build/test processes. Captured process exit status is an observation; candidate structured reports remain claims requiring recipe checks and independent expectations. Early trusted-host fixture tests must disclose that stronger hostile-code containment is not yet qualified. Qualify consequential gate discrimination on a passing baseline and an independently justified fault with the intended failure reason; include benign near-neighbors where false positives matter. Non-blocking authoring hooks do not satisfy required release gates.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T25 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T26 · Define the threat model and security review contract

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T26)

Dependencies: T01. Atlas task state: `done`.

**Acceptance:** Map task authority, context provenance, credentials, IPC, same-UID limits, isolation and trusted verifier ownership. Assign bounded negative cases and finding disposition. Confirm the selected security-model capability without granting extra execution authority. Include candidate-controlled build scripts, procedural macros, test binaries and Julia package hooks in the threat model; invoking them via a trusted verifier confers no collector authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T26 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T27 · Close security findings against the integrated release

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T27)

Dependencies: T15, T17, T18, T25, T26, T28, T29. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Reproduce material findings, verify fixes and residual dispositions on the actual packaged candidate. Prompt injection, credential exposure, socket/method misuse, stale writers, fabricated evidence, dependency drift and resource exhaustion cannot produce false acceptance. Model review alone is not closure. In disposable qualified fixtures, candidate build/test code attempts to alter protected fixture, evidence and control paths. The boundary must refuse the effect and the independent collector must expose the attempt; an exit-zero candidate report cannot certify its own integrity. Security fault cases require a valid unmutated baseline and the intended observable refusal. Preserve unmeasured/excluded scope; one corpus with no unique catch does not justify removing a gate.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T27 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T28 · Expose one authoritative action catalogue to CLI, API and LLM tools

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T28)

Dependencies: T03, T05, T06, T09, T25, T26. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** One action definition drives CLI/Unix schemas and one selected LLM-tool adapter. Bounded discovery/inspection/preview, scoped invocation, identity/idempotency and evidence readback work end to end. Denial remains denial across transports; untrusted workers receive no operator socket; generated projections cannot drift. task.get and analysis.get support their own principal-scoped admission-key readback; service.inspect can query the lifecycle operation key without confusing current health with historic effect. events.subscribe without a cursor provides a bounded coherent bootstrap snapshot plus high-water cursor. Distinguish request correlation from durable idempotency. Base Pi RPC does not supply the engine tool callback path; qualify the actual inherited channel or maintained bridge. Template-produced requests preserve literal typed values at the action boundary; model-emitted risk or approval fields never confer effect authority.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T28 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

### T29 · Qualify modular Bash, Pi, skill and workflow integration packages

[Owning task and current atlas state](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Delivery%2FTasks%2FTASK-T29)

Dependencies: T21, T22, T25, T26, T28. Atlas task state: `idle`.

**Acceptance:** Thin updatable packages share action/procedure identity and preserve authority, arguments, producer exit status, cancellation and evidence. Pi errors/parallel calls/reload and effective tool-set readback are qualified; skills disclose bounded context. Two typed compositions close their real return paths. Version switching preserves active attempts and rollback; no separate scheduler or silent self-update. Keep the admitted package/protocol tuple pinned through every active attempt. Revoked/reloaded tool handlers cannot retain effect authority. No custom Pi-host glue is selected until its concrete packaging need is established. Each integration renders its owned template once, then passes literal typed data rather than copying/re-templating procedure bodies. Focused fixtures include braces, quotes, newlines, dollar signs and leading dashes, with exact final argv/JSON and producer-status checks. Preserve source and relationship coverage with whole-workflow context accounting. Source-change reports cannot advance accepted compatibility/source baselines.

**Validator:** Proposed, not implemented: habitat-engine-check case T29 --fixture-root <disposable-fixtures>

## Closure and rollout discipline

Apply the existing plan → execute → observe → verify → repair/escalate → verify → close loop. Before deployment, qualify the assembled candidate and relevant T25/T26 checks, T17 failures, T27 security finding closure and T18 backup/upgrade/rollback obligations in their declared scope. T19/T20 govern pilot and release; these links do not mark them complete. Package and configuration identity must match observed installation and useful readback. Preserve cancellation, uncertain effects, cleanup and rollback obligations separately.

A successful compile or lint of comment-only stubs is not module verification. The Rust pedantic-Clippy/test plan, Julia checks, transport/fault cases and security reviews remain governed by their actual task criteria. [The evidence and update protocol](obsidian://open?vault=herdr-engineering-engine-v3.vault&file=Ultra%20Map%2FUpdate%20Protocol) refreshes all corpus views after retained observations are admitted.

## Remaining reference-example limits

Four of 21 planned actions illustrate admission. Complete schemas, durable idempotency/readback, every transport and full dispatch remain proposed.
